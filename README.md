### Shorey's Website for Advertising and Selling Winter Care Packages

Hello! The following info below is basically a "brief" tutorial on how to edit and maintain Shorey's UChicago Winter Care Package website.

## GitHub
If you're reading this, it's most likely through the website's GitHub Repository (repo for short)! \

This is where all of the code to edit and build our website is held. The **master** branch holds all the code. The **gh-pages** branch holds the actual HTML files that build the website. \

So, to begin with, if you want to help with this website, you'll need a github account. After you've created one, you can create a local copy of the website code on your computer.

#### Creating a Local Website Copy
To do this, navigate to the website's repo's "home page". This can be done by clicking on the repo's name in blue towards the top of the page. Should look something like *cchoy96/<this repo's name>*. \

Next, click on the green button towards the right of the screen that says **'Clone or download'**. Copy the url there to your clipboard, then open your Terminal.

In your terminal, navigate to whatever directory you want to have the website's files in. Then, type the following:
```
